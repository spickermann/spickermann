### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Software Engineer with more than fourteen years of profound knowledge in building web applications based on Ruby on Rails at scale.

I have practical experience as tech and team lead in start-ups and use an active hands-on and collaborative leadership style.

I identify myself as

 - an **Architect**. I worked with applications and databases that handled tens of millions of requests per day. I care about security and understand the high-security requirements of applications that deal with financial and personal data. I know it is important to always focus on well-structured systems that are easy to maintain and have up-to-date dependencies.
 - a **Teacher and Mentor**. It is important to me to help others improving in their craft and to shine. I coach and train junior developers in individual one-on-one sessions. I am an active member of the Ruby community, a maintainer and supporter of open source projects. As a Stack Overflow enthusiast I answered more than two thousand Ruby and Rails related questions.
 - a **Scientist**. I collect metrics and analyze data to understand and improve legacy codebases. I like to investigate hard to find bugs, to refactors unmaintainable code and optimize algorithms that do not scale well. I learned that a short-cut used today might need weeks to be fixed in the future and that good monitoring is important to build reliable fault- tolerant systems.
 - a **Team-Player**. Teams build better software than a single developer. I believe in agile methodologies, I see planing and whiteboard sessions as a chance to come up with better ideas, to share knowledge. Honest retrospectives in a psychological safety environment build trust and are a team bonding opportunity.
